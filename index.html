              <p>I was born October the 7th, 1995, in the LA suburb of Santa Monica. I am the first of three brothers and of nine grandchildren on my mother's side. While born in California my family relocated to Illinois to be closer to the rest of my maternal family. There I was quickly joined by my siblings and cousins with the added luxury of all living close to each other. Throughout my childhood I was rambunctious yet studious, always with my head in a book. This continued all throughout my teenage years and into higher education, receiving my BS from Ball State University in Indiana. In my spare time I enjoy photography, reading, vide games, and traveling the world. Perhaps one day you and I shall meet, and when we do I hope to give you a warm welcome.</p>
